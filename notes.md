1. font imports won't work when only put in the nuxtconfig.
Had to import them in the file with @import

2. ESlint default config is hell. Overriding VSCode settings, prettier settings, blablabla, fuck me

3. To make an element focusable - when it is not, most of them are - simply add tabindex="0".  
I did this because i wanted focus on a bunch of divs to navigate with the keyboard.
